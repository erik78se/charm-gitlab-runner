# This command checks if the registered runners can connect to GitLab,
# but it doesnâ€™t verify if the runners are being used by the
# GitLab Runner service.
#

# This operation cannot be undone. It updates the configuration file,
# so we make sure to have a backup of config.toml before executing it.
